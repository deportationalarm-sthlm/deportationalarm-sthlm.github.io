This is a call to airline and airport workers. We ask you to claim control of your work and not lend it for deportations. You have the power to stop your employer's deportation profiteering.

Your role is not to do the state's bidding. You are not police, you are not border guards, you can say no.

Pilots, you have the power to refuse to fly.

- Contact us

- Follow our anouncements of deportations. Upcoming deportations will be posted here, in our telegram and twitter channels

This is a call to airline and airport workers. 
Your work is what makes airtravel a possibility. It is by controlling your work that airlines make billions. And it is by controlling your work that airlines make money by deporting people on behalf of states. Freedom of movement is attacked, people are displaced, immobilized and devalued.

We ask you to claim control of your work, and not lend it to billionaire employers for deportations. We ask you to stop the deportations of other workers. We want to cultivate solidarity between struggles, so we ask support from you and we wish to support you in your labour battles in turn.

What can you and your coworkers do:
-Everyone can spread this page. We encourage you to spread it to all your coworkers

- Pilots successfully stop deportations. Pilots can refuse to fly if a person on the plane is being deported. 

- Cabin crew, if you think someone is being deported talk to them, talk to the pilot. You can refuse to sit or you can refuse to fly. 

-Air traffic controlers, baggage handlers, engineers and other workers can refuse to work if a deportation is being carried out. 
Workers can walk out of their workplace, call in sick together, or strike. 

-Contact us if you want to form a fighting union, or want support in your labour struggles. For your needs and the needs of migrants.
